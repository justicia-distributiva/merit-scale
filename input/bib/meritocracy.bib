  abstract = {Different beliefs about the fairness of social competition and what determines income inequality influence the redistributive policy chosen in a society. But the composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributivep olicies. (JEL D31, E62, H2, P16)},

We demonstrate that these findings are manifestations of measurement error associated with individual survey items. First, we show that averaging a large number of survey items on the same broadly defined issue area\textemdash for example, government involvement in the economy, or moral issues\textemdash eliminates a large amount of measurement error and reveals issue preferences that are well structured and stable. This stability increases steadily as the number of survey items increases and can approach that of party identification. Second, we show that once measurement error has been reduced through the use of multiple measures, issue preferences have much greater explanatory power in models of presidential vote choice, again approaching that of party identification.},

The data show the analytical preeminence within the individuation process in Chile of a group of competences that must be generated and developed in confronting social life itself. Individuation leads in Chile to the constitution of relational hyper-actors based upon four dimensions: self-effort, abilities, interpersonal relationships and pragmatic consistency. This is what we propose to understand as agentic individualism.},

A moral economy perspective considers how norms and beliefs structure socioeconomic practices through the constitution and expression of what is considered acceptable, proper, and legitimate. Our study explores how economic elites make sense of the roles of talent and effort in the distribution of resources and how they reconcile the idea of meritocracy within a rigid social order. The site of our study is Chile, a country with fluid mobility between low and middle classes, but with high and persistent disparities and strong barriers to elite positions. We conducted 44 semistructured interviews with shareholders, board members, and high-level executives of large or high-turnover companies in three major Chilean cities. We find that the economic elite strongly support meritocracy but explain access to top positions based on talent rather than effort. The economic elite define talent in terms of business and leadership skills. They attribute upward mobility in the private sector to meritocratic practice. At the same time, they view the public sector as the epitome of nonmeritocratic practices, incompetence, and inefficiency. They profess empathy with the poor, but they reject redistributive policies. The economic elite believe in the primacy of competition in economic life and the necessity of continual economic growth, and thus, they understand meritocracy as both the means to survive in a market economy and a responsible approach to lead national development.},

However, psychologists lack a means of assessing neoliberal beliefs directly. We collected data from three samples of U.S. undergraduates to develop and test a measure of neoliberal ideology, the Neoliberal Beliefs Inventory (NBI). Using first exploratory and then confirmatory factor analysis, we devised a 25-item measure that is both reliable and valid, at least within a particular demographic (i.e., U.S. traditionally-aged undergraduates). The NBI may help psychologists specify and analyze the role of neoliberal ideology in shaping human behavior and functioning.}

Der Erwerb von Bildung und Qualifikationen ist eine essentielle Voraussetzung f\"ur den Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt (Blossfeld 1989; Becker 1993; Hillmert und Mayer 2004; Solga 2005). F\"ur die Systemintegration, d.h. das reibungslose Funktionieren der gesellschaftlichen Teilsysteme, sowie f\"ur die Sozialintegration, d.h. die Teilhabe an gesellschaftlichen Teilbereichen, spielt daher der Zugang zu Bildung und Erwerb von Bildungszertifikaten ebenso eine bedeutsame Rolle wie der Zugang zum Arbeitsmarkt und der Erwerb von Einkommen (Lockwood 1964; Mayer 1994, 2000). Die Verteilung der G\"uter und Positionen im Bildungs- und Besch\"aftigungssystem erfolgt \textendash{} so die vorherrschende gesellschaftliche Vorstellung \textendash{} im Sinne von Chancengleichheit nach dem Leistungsprinzip, mit dem das Ausma\ss{} und die Struktur der sozialen Ungleichheit von Bildung, Status und Einkommen legitimiert werden (Hadjar 2008; Mayer 1975). Zugang zu Bildung oder Beruf und Erwerb von Bildung und Einkommen sollen demnach ausschlie\ss lich \"uber meritokratische Prinzipien als legitimer Mechanismus f\"ur die Verteilung von G\"utern und des gesellschaftlichen Status erfolgen. Die an Bildung gekn\"upfte und gesellschaftlich anerkannte Verteilung von Status, Einkommen, Macht und anderen Privilegien wird demzufolge aufgrund individueller Leistung als Indikator von im Wettbewerb erworbenen Verdiensten (,,contest mobility``) und nicht aufgrund von vererbtem Status etwa nach adliger Herkunft (,,sponsored mobility``) oder nach anderen askriptiven Merkmalen wie Geschlecht oder Rasse vorgenommen (vgl. Turner 1960). Eine Gesellschaft, die \"Amter, Ansehen und Reichtum ausschlie\ss lich nach Leistung vergibt, erscheint fairer als eine auf althergebrachten Privilegien beruhende Feudalgesellschaft oder als ein Wohlfahrtsstaat, der bestrebt ist, durch gezielte Eingriffe in die Lebensumst\"ande von Menschen individuelle und kollektive Chancengleichheit herzustellen. In einer meritokratischen Gesellschaft hingegen wird die soziale Schichtung nach sozialer Herkunft scheinbar durch eine soziale Schichtung nach individueller Leistung ersetzt. Das Leistungsprinzip auf der Basis einer Chancengleichheit im Bildungserwerb ist ihr entscheidendes Grundprinzip (Young 1958). Wenn sich aber in dieser Logik individuelle Leistung nicht mehr lohnt und soziale Ungleichheit nicht mehr mit rationalen Kriterien wie Talent, Anstrengung und Leistung legitimiert werden kann, scheinen die System- und Sozialintegration und damit auch der Zusammenhalt von Gesellschaften nicht mehr gew\"ahrleistet.},

Second, when giving a positive resource, American allocators are in a real dilemma: If they give on the basis of merit, they are rated high on the first cluster but low on the second; if they favor the needy, reactions reverse. No such dilemma exists for German allocators or in negative allocation situations where everyone approves of a need allocation. Third, Americans evaluate equality allocators quite highly, especially in the negative allocation condition. Fourth, allocators who have bonuses to distribute are evaluated more positively-another example of the fundamental attribution error.},

We find online convenience samples often provide valid inferences into how partisanship moderates treatment effects.

Several characteristic features of the American educational system are identified: the avoidance of early selection, the lack of sharp segmentation between different types of institutions, relative freedom of movement both among and within institutions, openness to new fields of study, high levels of enrollment, and the provision of opportunities for educational mobility well into adulthood. The two-year public community college, it argues, is an essential expression of these patterns which, through its very accessibility, reinforces the American ideology that it is never too late for individual talent to reveal itself - and to be rewarded. The article concludes with a discussion of the effects of the nation's distinctive school system on American culture and politics, suggesting that the perceived ldquoclasslessnessrdquo of American society may in part be a product of its seemingly open and democratic structure of education.

The present research proposes a conceptual and empirical framework for studying meritocratic perceptions and preferences, which is then related with economic inequality variables. Using data from the Chilean survey ``Social justice and citizenship participation'', the analyses suggest that meritocratic perceptions and preferences are different constructs and that those perceiving an adequate functioning of meritocracy also perceive less economic inequality.}

  abstract = {Studies on national identity differentiate between nationalistic attitudes and constructive patriotism (CP) as two more specific expressions of national identity and as theoretically two distinct concepts. After a brief discussion of the theoretical literature, the following questions are examined: (1) Can nationalism and CP be empirically identified as two distinct concepts?; (2) Is their meaning fully or partially invariant across countries?; and (3) Is it possible to compare their means across countries? Data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2003 National Identity Module are utilized to answer these questions in a sample of 34 countries. Items to measure nationalism and CP are chosen based on the literature, and a series of confirmatory factor analyses to test for configural, measurement (metric), and scalar invariance are performed. Full or partial metric invariance is a necessary condition for equivalence of meaning across cultures and for a meaningful comparison of associations with other theoretical constructs. Scalar invariance is a necessary condition for comparison of means across countries. Findings reveal that nationalism and CP emerge as two distinct constructs. However, in some countries, some items that were intended to measure one construct also measure the other construct. Furthermore, configural and metric invariance are found across the full set of 34 countries. Consequently, researchers may now use the ISSP data to study relationships among nationalism, CP, and other theoretical constructs across these nations. However, the analysis did not support scalar invariance, making it problematic for comparing the means of nationalism and CP across countries.},

Using the International Social Survey Program Social Inequality III (1999) survey, we investigate the impact of education on perceptions and support, at both the individual and the country level. At the individual level, education strengthens support for education-based meritocracy but has less impact on perceptions of meritocracy. National indicators are also associated with perceived and preferred meritocracy. Perceived meritocracy is correlated with the expansion of the education system, while the support for education-based meritocracy is correlated with average returns to education. We also find that perceptions and preferences may be affected by such national characteristics as inequality and the average wealth.}

Although some research indirectly suggests that believing that meritocracy exists may increase wellbeing, group consciousness theories suggest that disbelieving that meritocracy exists will enhance psychological adjustment to gender discrimination. Women who reported little past experience with discrimination, and either believed or disbelieved that meritocracy exists, were exposed to either a laboratory situation of discrimination or a nondiscrimination failure (control) condition. Consistent with group consciousness theories, women experiencing discrimination reported greater well-being if they disbelieved that meritocracy exists than if they were believers. In contrast, women in the control condition reported greater wellbeing if they believed that meritocracy exists than if they were disbelievers. Implications for coping with discrimination are discussed.},

We outline an argument that addresses how the magnitude of macrolevel income inequalities affects perceptions of the distribution of merit in a society. We propose that higher levels of economic inequality will lead to perceptions of greater differences in merit such that societies with higher inequality will be characterized by a larger ``merit gap,'' namely, larger differences in the perceived merit of the rich and poor. We test these arguments using an online experiment that manipulated the level of inequality (high vs. low) in an anonymized society. Participants perceived a larger merit gap in high versus low inequality societies. Our arguments and findings have implications for attitudes about inequality and redistributive policies.}

  abstract = {Abstract This study reviews international comparative studies investigating people's views on inequality. These studies are classified using a framework consisting of three types of conceptions of inequality and two dimensions of inequality. Four perspectives are discussed explaining cross-national differences in views on inequality: the modernist, the culturalist, the micro and the macro perspective. The findings of studies comparing views on inequalities in post-communist and Western states provide more support for the modernist than for the culturalist perspective. Few comparative studies appear to investigate views on inequalities as independent variables impacting on other social attitudes and behaviours. It is argued that the social relevance of the field will be enhanced if more studies can show that views on inequality have an effect on social outcomes complementary to that of objective inequalities. , R\'esum\'e L'\'etude fait le tour des comparaisons internationales qui ont analys\'e les opinions sur l'in\'egalit\'e. On peut les classer \`a partir de trois conceptions de l'in\'egalit\'e et de deux dimensions. On obtient en fait quatre mod\`eles qui rendent compte des diff\'erences entre nations : le moderniste, le culturaliste, la perspective micro et la perspective macro. Les donn\'ees comparatives pour les pays ex-communistes et les pays occidentaux s'accordent mieux avec une perspective moderniste que culturaliste. Les \'etudes comparatives ont fort peu trait\'e les jugements sur l'in\'egalit\'e comme variables ind\'ependantes ayant un impact sur d'autres attitudes et comportements sociaux. La pertinence sociale de ce champ d'\'etudes serait augment\'ee si davantage d'\'etudes montraient que les jugements sur l'in\'egalit\'e ont des effets sociaux qui s'ajoutent \`a ceux des in\'egalit\'es objectives. , Zusammenfassung Dieser Beitrag interessiert sich f\"ur internationale vergleichende Studien, die die Anschauungen \"uber Ungleichheit zum Thema haben. Diese Studien lassen sich in drei Konzepte und zwei Dimensionen von Ungleichheit einteilen. Daraus entstehen vier Modelle, die die unterschiedlichen nationalen Betrachtungsweisen von Ungleichheit erkl\"aren: die modernistische Perspektive, die kulturelle Perspektive, die Mikroperspektive und die Makroperspektive. Die vergleichenden Angaben ehemaliger kommunistischer und westlicher L\"ander stimmen eher mit der modernistischen als mit der kulturalistischen Perspektive \"uberein. Nur wenige der vergleichenden Studien scheinen Ungleichheiten als unabh\"angige Variablen zu verstehen, die zu anderen sozialen Formen und Verhaltensweisen f\"uhren k\"onnten. Die soziale Bedeutung dieses Studienbereichs k\"onnte zunehmen, falls mehrere Untersuchungen zeigen w\"urden, dass die Einstufungen der Ungleichheit soziale Auswirkungen haben, die zu den objektiven Ungleichheiten hinzugef\"ugt werden m\"ussen.},

  abstract = {Merit is a key principle of fairness: rewards should be distributed according to how much someone contributed to a task. Previous research suggests that children have an early ability to take merit into account in third-party situations but that merit-based sharing in first-party contexts does not emerge until school-age. Here we provide evidence that three- and five-year-old children already use merit to share resources with others, even when sharing is costly for the child. In Study 1, a child and a puppet-partner collected coins that were later exchanged for rewards. We varied the work-contribution of both partners by manipulating how many coins each partner collected. Children kept fewer stickers in trials in which they had contributed less than in trials in which they had contributed more than the partner, showing that they took merit into account. Few children, however, gave away more than half of the stickers when the partner had worked more. Study 2 confirmed that children related their own work-contribution to their partner's, rather than simply focusing on their own contribution. Taken together, these studies show that merit-based sharing is apparent in young children; however it remains constrained by a self-serving bias.},

Rex is a scholar of SEM and has a special gift\textemdash of being able to communicate complex statistical concepts in language that all readers can grasp. The accessible style of writing and the many pedagogical features of the book (e.g., chapter-end annotated reading lists, exercises with answers) make it a "must have" for any user of SEM. It is a resource that keeps improving and expanding with each new edition and is the resource I recommend first on this subject\textemdash whether the question comes from a beginner or an experienced user. As a scholar of modern statistical practice and techniques. Rex has studied the developments and advances in the world of SEM generally, and he has covered "hot" topics, such as Pearl's structural causal modeling. His coverage of Pearl's graph theory approach to causal reasoning, as many of the reviewers of prepublication drafts of the fourth edition have also noted, is both easy to understand and comprehensive. It's so good, he ought to get a prize for best in presentation! In this new edition, he takes us through causal mediation analysis, conditional process modeling, and confirmatory factor analysis with categorical indicators. Other additions to this masterpiece of pedagogy include insightful discussions of significance testing, the use of bootstrap estimation, and the principles of measurement theory. Although Rex suggests in his Introduction that no single book can cover all of SEM, his book is about as thorough as they come. His didactic approach is refreshing and engaging, and the breadth and depth of material covered is simply impressive. As he notes and you will feel. Rex is a researcher talking to you as a fellow researcher, carefully explaining in conceptually driven terms the logic and principles that underlie the world of SEM. The wealth of examples provide entry points for researchers across a broad array of disciplines. This book will speak to you regardless of your field or specific area of expertise.

Following Krauze and Slomczynski, the author defines meritocratic allocation of individuals by education to occupational status groups as a situation when more educated persons do not have jobs with lower status than less educated persons. Using data from the European Social Survey rounds 1 to 8, for each country-round, the author identifies the theoretical meritocratic joint distribution of education and occupational status, as well as the theoretical distribution under statistical independence, and measures the distance of empirical distributions to these two ideal situations. The author finds that the distance to meritocracy varies substantially across European countries, with some countries being closer to allocation under independence than to meritocratic allocation. In terms of cross-country differences, the distance to meritocracy is smaller in postcommunist countries than in Western Europe, with some convergence observable over time.}

A simple model of meritocratic allocation is proposed and applied to provide empirical assessment of "how far to meritocracy?" from empirical reality. The model, conceptualized as an ideal type of meritocracy, incorporates the principle according to which more educated persons do not have lower status than less educated ones. Assuming that a meritocratic society should resemble its ideal type, we have formulated three testable hypotheses involving status mobility within educational groups, status determination by education, and status inequality among educational groups. The tests consist of evaluating the discrepancies between the data on the U.S. total labor force and the model. All three hypotheses implying that American society is close to meritocracy are rejected.}

Using the International Social Survey Project (ISSP): Social Inequality Module (1992), we examine both individual-level and country-level determinants of pro-meritocratic attitudes. According to self-interest and rational-action theories, individuals with high educational attainment and high personal income are expected to have strong meritocratic beliefs because meritocracy is in their best interest\textemdash they would gain under such a system. At the same time, both modernization and post-industrial theories imply that persons living in countries with a high degree of societal meritocracy hold stronger meritocratic beliefs than persons living in countries with low degree of societal meritocracy. Results of the Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis on a data set including 7,972 persons from 14 countries indicate that the impact of individuals' education and income on meritocratic attitudes occurred as theoretically predicted. We also demonstrate that the relationship between the degree of societal meritocracy and the degree of support for such a system is statistically significant even if national wealth and educational stock (as well as individual-level variables) are controlled. In addition, we discovered that at the beginning of the 1990s a post-communist regime had a negative effect on support for meritocracy.}

  abstract = {Psychological interest in Meritocracy as an important social norm regulating most of the western democratic societies has significantly increased over the years. However, the way Meritocracy has been conceptualized and operationalized in experimental studies has advanced in significant ways. As a result, a variety of paradigms arose to understand the social consequences of Meritocracy for intergroup relations; in particular, to understand the adverse consequences of Meritocracy for disadvantaged group members. The present research seeks to understand whether there is strong support for the idea that (manipulated) Meritocracy disproportionally affects members of low status groups, and also to understand which specific components of this norm have been successfully manipulated and to what consequences. And this is particularly important given the recent call for greater transparency in how the success of experimental manipulations is reported. Thus, we carried out a systematic review examining the content of different prime tasks, summarizing prime manipulation checks' effectiveness, and analyzing whether priming Meritocracy leads to less favorable orientations toward low status groups. Results across 33 studies revealed that despite the existing differences in the components highlighted, the salience of any of the Meritocracy dimensions facilitates the use of internal causal attributions, negative evaluations and stereotyping towards low status groups, affecting negatively decisions involving low-status group members, particularly in specific domains, as organizational contexts. These results carry both practical and theoretical implications for future research on the role of Meritocracy in intergroup settings.},

  abstract = {Economic inequality has been on the rise in the United States since the 1980s and by some measures stands at levels not seen since before the Great Depression. Although the strikingly high and rising level of economic inequality in the nation has alarmed scholars, pundits, and elected officials alike, research across the social sciences repeatedly concludes that Americans are largely unconcerned about it. Considerable research has documented, for instance, the important role of psychological processes, such as system justification and American Dream ideology, in engendering Americans' relative insensitivity to economic inequality. The present work offers, and reports experimental tests of, a different perspective\textemdash the opportunity model of beliefs about economic inequality. Specifically, two convenience samples (study 1, n = 480; and study 2, n = 1,305) and one representative sample (study 3, n = 1,501) of American adults were exposed to information about rising economic inequality in the United States (or control information) and then asked about their beliefs regarding the roles of structural (e.g., being born wealthy) and individual (e.g., hard work) factors in getting ahead in society (i.e., opportunity beliefs). They then responded to policy questions regarding the roles of business and government actors in reducing economic inequality. Rather than revealing insensitivity to rising inequality, the results suggest that rising economic inequality in contemporary society can spark skepticism about the existence of economic opportunity in society that, in turn, may motivate support for policies designed to redress economic inequality.},

  abstract = {Most people misperceive economic inequality. Learning about actual levels of inequality and social mobility, research suggests, heightens concerns but may push people's policy preferences in any number of directions. This mixed empirical record, we argue, reflects the omission of a more fundamental question: under what conditions do people change their understanding of the meritocratic or non-meritocratic causes of inequality? To explore mechanisms of belief change we field a unique randomized survey experiment with representative populations in Australia, Indonesia, and Mexico\textemdash societies with varying levels of and popular beliefs about economic inequality. Our results highlight the importance of information, perceived social position, and self-interest. In Indonesia, information describing (high) income inequality and (low) social mobility rocked our participants' belief in meritocracy. The same information made less of a splash in Mexico, where unequal outcomes are commonly understood as the result of corruption and other non-meritocratic processes. In Australia, the impact of our information treatment was strongest when it provided justification for people's income position or when it corrected their perception of relative affluence. Our findings reveal asymmetric beliefs about poverty and wealth and heterogeneous responses to information. They are a call to rethink effective informational and policy interventions.}

  abstract = {This paper draws on a literature in sociology, psychology and economics that has extensively documented the unfulfilled promise of meritocracy in education. I argue that the lesson learned from this literature is threefold: (1) educational institutions in practice significantly distort the ideal meritocratic process; (2) opportunities for merit are themselves determined by non-meritocratic factors; (3) any definition of merit must favor some groups in society while putting others at a disadvantage. Taken together, these conclusions give reason to understand meritocracy not just as an unfulfilled promise, but as an unfulfillable promise. Having problematized meritocracy as an ideal worth striving for, I argue that the pervasiveness of meritocratic policies in education threatens to crowd out as principles of justice, need and equality. As such, it may pose a barrier rather than a route to equality of opportunity. Furthermore, meritocratic discourse legitimates societal inequalities as justly deserved such as when misfortune is understood as personal failure. The paper concludes by setting a research agenda that asks how citizens come to hold meritocratic beliefs; addresses the persistence of (unintended) meritocratic imperfections in schools; analyzes the construction of a legitimizing discourse in educational policy; and investigates how education selects and labels winners and losers.}

Studying trends in attitudes is limited by the paucity of survey data that can be compared across countries and over time. Here, I show how to complement survey waves with cohort-level data. Repeated surveys draw on a representative sample of the population to describe the typical beliefs held by citizens in a given country and period. Leveraging the fact that citizens surveyed in a given year were born in different time-periods allows for a comparison of beliefs across birth cohorts. The latter overlaps with the former, but considerably extends the time period covered by the data. Taken together, the two measures give a ``triangulated'' longitudinal record of popular belief in meritocracy. I find that in most countries, popular belief in meritocracy is (much) stronger for more recent periods and cohorts.}

  abstract = {Researchers often compare groups of individuals on psychological variables. When comparing groups an assumption is made that the instrument measures the same psychological construct in all groups. If this assumption holds, the comparisons are valid and differences/similarities between groups can be meaningfully interpreted. If this assumption does not hold, comparisons and interpretations are not fully meaningful. The establishment of measurement invariance is a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons across groups. This paper first reviews the importance of equivalence in psychological research, and then the main theoretical and methodological issues regarding measurement invariance within the framework of confirmatory factor analysis. A step-by-step empirical example of measurement invariance testing is provided along with syntax examples for fitting such models in LISREL.},

  abstract = {I have written this book with several goals in mind. The first goal is to acquaint the reader with the broad set of statistical procedures currently used to approach the problem of detecting measurement bias. A second goal, which follows upon the first, is to provide the necessary background material so that readers can place the many detection procedures in context. Toward that end, the book devotes considerable space to describing the measurement models that underlie psychometric practice. I have also included some theoretical results that subsume many types of detection procedures, showing their strengths and limitations. Finally, I hope that the book will inspire more researchers to become involved in bias detection research. The problem of detecting bias in psychological measures is a difficult one, and it represents a significant challenge to measurement in psychology. In addition to the detection problem itself, the measurement bias problem has implications for the use of tests in many domains as predictors or as tools for making decisions about people. The last chapter of the book explores these implications for the use of tests in prediction and for the related problem of bias in prediction. The intended audience for this book consists of researchers and students who wish to understand the array of available procedures for detecting bias in psychological measurement. The problem of measurement bias arises in many research settings, ranging from applied research in employment or educational testing to the use of tests or questionnaires in experimental studies with multiple groups. I hope that the book will serve as a useful reference for researchers in all of these settings. The book is intended to also serve as a resource for students who want to learn more about psychometrics, particularly in relation to the problem of measurement bias as a challenge to the validity of measurement. To benefit from the book, a student should have an understanding of basic probability and statistical theory, along with some knowledge of regression. The overall structure of the book can be described as follows. Chapter 1 presents some basic information about the definition of measurement bias and how the book will examine this topic. Chapter 2 reviews the measurement models used in psychometric theory. Emphasis is placed on latent variable models, with introductions to classical test theory, factor analysis, and item response theory, along with the controversies associated with each. Measurement invariance and bias in the context of multiple populations is defined in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the common factor model for continuous measures in multiple populations and its use in the investigation of factorial invariance. It examines identification problems in confirmatory factor analysis along with estimation and fit evaluation and provides an example using WAIS-R data. The factor analysis model for discrete measures in multiple populations with an emphasis on the specification, identification, estimation, and fit evaluation issues is addressed in Chapter 5. An MMPI example is also provided. Chapter 6 reviews both dichotomous and polytomous item response models emphasizing estimation methods and model fit evaluations. The use of models in item response theory in evaluating invariance across multiple populations is then described in Chapter 7, including an example that uses data from a large-scale achievement test. Chapter 8 examines item bias evaluation methods that use observed scores to match individuals and provides an example that uses the same achievement test data from the previous chapter. Finally, the book concludes with Chapter 9, which discusses the implications of measurement bias for the use of tests in prediction, as in educational or employment settings.

This article analyzes the impact of local inequality on citizens' belief in a core facet of the American ethos\textemdash meritocracy. We advance conditional effects hypotheses that collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal counties, we find no significant differences between high- and low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality for American democracy.}

Few studies, however, have examined whether people believe they live in a meritocratic society. In this paper, we use the 1987 and 2010 General Social Survey to examine people's perceptions of meritocracy in the U.S. Although most Americans agree that getting ahead depends on meritocratic elements like hard work, their beliefs vary in strength. They disagree even more about the importance of non-meritocratic elements such as family wealth, and race. Furthermore, Americans layer these beliefs on top of each other to create a variety of perspectives on meritocracy. Young, upper class Whites are most likely to see the U.S. as a place where meritocratic elements rule. Older, lower class minorities, in contrast, are most likely to believe that non-meritocratic elements dominate. There are also Americans who believe strongly in both types of elements and those who do not believe strongly in either.},

Besides this, attitudes towards income inequality are influenced by inequality-legitimising myths in a given society. Little is known about how these two factors interact. This study combines these two lines of research and argues that different social strata are more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies with strong prevalent meritocratic perceptions. We expect lower-status individuals (i.e. with a lower income or education) to experience a threat to their group esteem and therefore be less likely to support their society's inequalities in societies with such strong meritocratic perceptions. This hypothesis was tested using data from the International Social Survey Programme 2009 (Social Inequality) on 39 countries. The results show that different social strata are indeed more polarised in their attitudes towards inequality in societies where meritocratic perceptions are more prevalent. Our results are robust for income, but not for education. This suggests that in perceived meritocracies, people regard income as the primary indicator of effort and ability.}

The assumption has been made that disparity ratios as high as 4:1 and odds ratios as high as 36:1 cannot be reconciled with the existence of equality of opportunity and that the meritocratic hypothesis has, therefore, been disproved. However, this research has never collected data on differences of ability and effort which may exist between members of different social classes, so the meritocracy hypothesis has never been properly tested. When a model of `perfect mobility' is fitted to John Goldthorpe's data on class origins and destinations, an extraordinarily close fit is obtained. It is clear that the meritocracy thesis is entirely consistent with the data reported in recent mobility studies and that it has not been disproved after all.},

We find that individuals tend to use all or most of these principles simultaneously in making distributive justice judgments, but that they weigh them differently according to various factors. In particular, we find an expectedly strong difference between how women and men use and weigh these principles. This gender difference parallels-and may even underlie- the gender gap observed in political and policy preferences. CR - Copyright \textcopyright{} 2001 Midwest Political Science Association},

In this article, we analyze change in a core set of societal norms\textemdash beliefs in distributive justice\textemdash in the Czech Republic over the last two decades, and locate those trends in regional perspective. What we find is that, over time, the negative association between egalitarian and meritocratic norms has increasingly strengthened, suggesting a crystallization of those norms as opposing value sets. In addition, attachments to those norms are increasingly structured by respondents' socio-economic status. In order words, the research confirms that subjective norms in the Czech Republic are increasingly shaped by objective social status in ways common in advanced democracies, and that we can speak not only of a crystallization of the value system, but of a corresponding ``re-stratification'' of justice beliefs in relation to social position.},

In 4 studies, participants' preference for the merit principle and hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were assessed; later, the participants evaluated organizational selection practices that support or challenge the status quo. Participants' prescriptive and descriptive beliefs about merit were separate constructs; only the latter predicted other hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies. In addition, as hypothesized, among participants who weakly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies, the stronger their preference for the merit principle, the more they opposed selection practices that were perceived to be merit violating but the more they supported practices that were perceived to be merit restoring. In contrast, those who strongly endorsed hierarchy-legitimizing ideologies were always motivated to support the status quo, regardless of their preference for the merit principle.}

It first questions the meritocratic ideal highlighting how it relates to normative expectations that do not hold fully neither in their logic nor in practice. It then complements the literature on persistent inequalities by focusing on the opportunities for change created by current trends in the economy and in social aspirations. As the meritocratic argument that education is strongly linked to certain rewards in the labour market comes under pressure, increasing social dissatisfaction with education and skills wastage could be expected, as already noted in part of the political economy literature. This literature, however, has tended to conclude from such observations that educational expansion cannot deliver equality. The paper contributes to the debate by focusing on the opportunities created by current trends for the reorganisation of the relationship between education, the economy and society.}

Renewed consolidation efforts, under the pressure of `financial markets', point to a general decline in state expenditure, particularly discretionary and investment expenditure, and of extensive retrenchment and privatization of state functions.}

  abstract = {Corruption has a wide range of corrosive effects on societies, but it is widespread throughout the world. There is a question, however, as to whether corruption is endorsed as an outcome of a legitimate hierarchy and meritocracy. To address this issue, the present study examines the associations between meritocratic ideology and the indicators of corruption by performing two empirical studies with correlational and experimental designs. In Study 1, all variables were measured with scales, and the results demonstrated that meritocratic ideologies were negatively associated with corruption perception but positively associated with corrupt intention. In Study 2, meritocratic ideology was manipulated, and the results demonstrated that compared with the low meritocratic-ideology condition, the participants primed by the high meritocratic-ideology condition reported a lower corruption perception but higher corrupt intention. In both studies, the findings suggest that the meritocratic ideology that motivates people to maintain and bolster the current hierarchical structure and meritocracy leads to the endorsement of corruption. The present study explores the roles of meritocratic ideology in the perception and intention of corruption, extends the scope of the predictive power of system justification theory to corruption beyond mere injustice-related aspects of disadvantage, and also provides suggestions for interpreting and fighting against corruption.},

  abstract = {A quarter century ago, an important finding in stratification research showed that the intergenerational occupational association was much weaker among college graduates than among those with lower levels of education. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the ``meritocratic power'' of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor's degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor's degree alone.}

By establishing whether factor loadings, intercepts and residual variances are equivalent in a factor model that measures a latent concept, we can assure that comparisons that are made on the latent variable are valid across groups or time. Establishing measurement invariance involves running a set of increasingly constrained structural equation models, and testing whether differences between these models are significant. This paper provides a step-by-step guide to analysing measurement invariance.},

  abstract = {What Jonsson (1993) has labelled the `Increased Merit Selection' (IMS) hypothesis suggests that access to education becomes increasingly determined by class origin and that class destination is increasingly dependent on educational achievement, as the influence of characteristics associated with family background become irrelevant. It is on this latter relationship that we shall focus in this contribution. The liberal theory of industrialism held that economically advanced societies would exhibit a high level of social mobility because the increasing number of professional and managerial positions would be filled on the basis of meritocratic principles. `Achieved' characteristics' would displace `ascribed' characteristics as determinants of social position and objective universalistic criteria would displace particularistic standards. (Blau and Duncan, 1967, Parsons, 1954, Treiman, 1970). In such circumstances what is to count as merit? Two main answers have been proposed. The first, which is of direct interest to us, suggests that merit should be equated with educational qualifications. The second definition, which must be addressed if are to be in a position to interpret the evidence relating to the changing impact of education, views merit as constituted by the combined impact of IQ and effort. While, as Jackson (2002) notes, there has been a tendency to treat these two definitions as functionally equivalent, with education providing a proxy measure of IQ and effort, this view has been increasingly challenged,},

  abstract = {We examine the extent to which Americans and Chinese perceive their countries as meritocracies. Chinese and Americans share a strong belief in the importance of education, ambition, and hard work for getting ahead. The Chinese, however, also believe strongly in nonmeritocratic elements, especially social ties. They are thus much more likely than Americans to have a dual-consciousness about getting ahead. Perceptions also vary within each country. In the United States, minorities perceive less meritocracy than whites and men perceive less meritocracy than women. These factors, however, do not explain variations in Chinese perceptions, which are more closely tied to China-specific predictors (e.g., hukou status). We also find that Chinese perceptions reflect the degree of contact with nonrelatives and people in occupations more prestigious than one's own. Together, these findings suggest that American beliefs about the role of merit in social mobility are not unique. They also highlight a need for studies of stratification beliefs in nondemocratic, non-Western countries and research that examines how life experiences influence stratification beliefs.},

However, such convenience samples are not generally representative of the population. We developed and validated a new quota sampling method to recruit respondents using Facebook advertisements. Additionally, we published an R package to semi-automate this quota sampling process using the Facebook Marketing API. To test the method, we used Facebook advertisements to quota sample 2432 US respondents for a survey on climate change public opinion. We conducted a contemporaneous nationally representative survey asking identical questions using a high-quality online survey panel whose respondents were recruited using probability sampling. Many results from the Facebook-sampled survey are similar to those from the online panel survey; furthermore, results from the Facebook-sampled survey approximate results from the American Community Survey (ACS) for a set of validation questions. These findings suggest that using Facebook to recruit respondents is a viable option for survey researchers wishing to approximate population-level public opinion.},
